ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Roman, a data enthusiast with a passion for web scraping, data analysis, and visualization. I thrive on turning data into actionable insights.

ðŸ‘€ I'm deeply interested in web scraping, where I explore and extract valuable data. My expertise extends to data analysis, visualization, and the art of storytelling with data. I enjoy uncovering hidden patterns and trends.

ðŸ’¼ I bring a wealth of experience in revenue management, asset management, and financial and data analysis, primarily within the lodging industry. My career has honed my analytical skills and equipped me to work with complex data sets.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning SQL, python (pandas, BeautifulSoup, sickit-learn, numpy, and other packages), and Tableau.
