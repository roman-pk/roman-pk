- 👋 Hi, I’m Roman!
- 👀 I’m interested in web scraping, data analysis, visualization, story telling, and, of course, generating actionable insight through data. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL, python (pandas, BeautifulSoup, sickit-learn, numpy, and other packages), and Tableau. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on best practices for analyzing open source data and presenting it to the public. Maybe learning how to blog? 
- 📫 How to reach me:  <a href='http://linkedin.com/in/romanpk/'>LinkedIn</a> or <a href='https://twitter.com/theromanpk'>Twitter</a>
